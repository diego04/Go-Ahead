# Go-Ahead
An isomorphic app for learning programming and algorithms.

## Why React Native / React?

- [x] Makes app logic easier. Check Facebook's blog about how it benefited their team [here](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1189117404435352/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/)
- [x] Fast development cycles.
- [x] Economically feasible.
- [x] Molding the UI becomes simple.
- [x] Colossal ecosystem. Check it out [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
- [x] Freedom to use pre-existing javascript libraries like [this](https://www.npmjs.com/)

- [x] Improved separation of concerns
- [x] Write code once-ish, test everywhere


## Why an Isomorphic App?

- [x] Fast prototyping to verify MVP / domain logic
- [x] Low overhead
- [x] Reusable components
- [x] One language in the middle-tier, client-tier

## Technology (To be decided)

- [x] React-Native for iOS and Android
- [] Node.js in the middle-tier (Express, Hapi, or Koa)
- [] Backend (Mongo, Postgress)
- [] Firebase
